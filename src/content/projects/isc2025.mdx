## Thoughts

Mostly for fun. Met great people at [Expand Space](https://expandspace.com/), won 1st runner up of $1000. &lt;&gt;. More information on the [ISC website](https://spacefaculty.asia/isc17/).

## Theme of the year: Living in Space

Living in Space presents a multitude of challenges, from the unforgiving environment to the logistical complexities of sustaining life beyond our planet. But these challenges also hold immense potential, not only for pushing the boundaries of human exploration, but also for improving life back on Earth through advancements in healthcare and food security.

## Problem

Design a life science experiment that not only pushes the boundaries of our understanding of living in space but also holds the potential to improve lives on Earth for humans.

## Solution

BLOOM (Bacterial Lunar Organic Optimisation Mission) â€” a deployable, autonomous lab to investigate cultivating bio-remedial bacteria on the moon. Aims to support sustainable lunar agriculture while offering insights to benefit life on Earth ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ•.
