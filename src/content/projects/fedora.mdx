import Kitty from '../assets/fedora/kitty.png';

## TLDR;

Started off with Mint and Gnome, wanted something more customisable and also to learn more about Linux in general. Moved over to Pop!OS with [Cosmic DE](https://system76.com/cosmic) when it was still in Beta. Had many bugs, looked in to immutable distros such as [Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/), [Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/), [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) , and [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/en) - for the containerisation/cloud native features and also **dinosaurs** and **auroras**.

Settled on KDE Plasma 6 for customisability and also to learn the linux ecosystem.
