## Thoughts

First hackathon where we made it to the finals and emerged as Top 3, with an overall prize of SGD$3000 ðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’µ. Competing against other teams in the local University category, we had low expectations but were met with a pleasant surprise since it was a very last-minute decision to participate in the challenge. Presenting our solution on stage to a large audience and to judges from distinguished companies such as RedHat, Dell Technologies, SCDF, and AsiaPac was a nerve-wrecking experience, but good practice overall. Here are some event pictures:

## About the Hackathon

The second edition of Dell Technologiesâ€™ Hackathon-with-a-Heart, [InnovateFest 2024](https://www.dell.com/en-sg/dt/corporate/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2024~09~20240926-dell-innovatefest-2024--hackathon-tackles-social-isolation-for-seniors-and-pwids.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-sg) witnessed the final presentations by young talents from universities and polytechnics and was jointly organized with Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) and Lions Befrienders. This yearâ€™s theme focuses on solving social isolation challenges faced by persons with intellectual disabilities (PWIDs) and the vulnerable aged community.

## Our Solution

A brief overview of our proposed solution's technical architecture diagram:

</div>

The solution, **LepakLah!**, as the name suggests, essentially seeks to empower tech-savvy elderly who face difficulties securing slots at Lions Befriender's activity centres due to limited slots and inefficient bidding systems with a one-stop app. We also seek to promote active aging, strengthen community ties and ensure that seniors have access to activities that truly resonate with their interests. This is done via a simulated buddy-matching recommendation system that takes into account the users' interests to pair up participants who are signing up for a particular event. 

Furthermore, event ideation, logistics, and promotion are done via the app automatically with an LLM and Image-generation model hosted on Nvidia's NIM platform. This will support the activity centre staff in creating and managing centre-run events.

This was our first time working with the tech-stack in a small production-environment, especially with managing docker containers, and Kubernetes clusters on OpenShift. Find out more about the project in the GitHub link!
