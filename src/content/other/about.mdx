I study Systems Engineering (Business Analytics, minor in AI), and build systems where research meets production. I’m fascinated by tech for public good and enjoy turning complex problems into reliable tools. Lately, that’s meant working on multi-agent LLM systems and learning how to make data workflows scalable and resilient in the cloud (AWS). 

My current focus is on data engineering and cloud infrastructure: I’m building pipelines that reliably move and transform data, experimenting with orchestration patterns, and deploying models so they’re useful outside notebooks.

Outside of code, I capture the world through photography, recharge on hikes, run for clarity, and travel to learn new perspectives. Someday I plan to adopt a cat 🐱!
